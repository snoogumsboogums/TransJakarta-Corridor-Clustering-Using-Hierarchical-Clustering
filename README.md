This project analyzes TransJakarta corridors based on passenger volume data in 2024 using the Hierarchical Clustering method.

The objective is to group corridors with similar passenger characteristics to identify patterns, density levels, and potential operational insights.

Hierarchical Clustering is applied to segment corridors into clusters based on their passenger volume distribution, helping support data-driven decision making in public transportation management.
